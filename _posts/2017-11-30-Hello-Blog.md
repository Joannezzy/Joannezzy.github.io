# Hello Blog
Hello blog.  
Thanks to `jekyll` and `github Page`, as well as `NexT` which offers such an elegant template, I could build my blog in such a handy way.  
`vSpace` means `virtual space`.  
# About Blog
I will be writing the blog in both Chinese or English, depending on my convenience. My notes, ideas, questions, or whatever I am currently doing would be post if it is worth a share.  
Regular update is never guaranteed.   
# Blogs Organization
Blogs will be grouped by `tags` and `category`.  
`Tag`indicates the `language(s)` the blog involvs, such as `C`, `C++`. A blog without `tags` is possible.  
`Category`indicates the `field` it is mainly about, such as `Operating System`, `Algorithm`. `Category` is also optional.  
Hopefully, it will save you (and I of course) a lot of time.
Don't forget to use the `search` function on the main menu (supported by `NexT`, thanks again). It is a poweful, quick and real-time search.
